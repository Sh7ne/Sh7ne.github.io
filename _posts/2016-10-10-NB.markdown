> “Do you have a portfolio?”


## Before Everything



[skip the superfluous words ](#build) 

Just Graduated from the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada before July this year. Trying to seek a job related to UI/UX or Web designer. Evertime I inquire about a job on some job-posting-site, the first question they asked me is always the same. 

"Do you hava a *portfolio*?"

After serval times, I think I got to build one.


Here is a link to my *Porfolio* Page which I haven't post a lot of content on it.

## Body

Let's talk about the detail of this Blog。  

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) 

A straightforward way for Building Blog.

Pros:

* **Markdown** 
* Git workflow ，**Git Commit equals to Blog Post**
* GitHub Pages  Free and unlimited space
	* Only need to adjust DNS and CNAME if you need a personal domain 
* Jekyll is super easy to customize 





## After

As I said, finall I got a blog and a place to put my Portpolio which make me have to clear up my works and get them reorganized.
